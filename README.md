This is just some example code for taking a local CSV file and importing each row as a node into Drupal.

1. Installation
```
npm install
```

2. Edit the index.js file with the CSV file location, Url, Username/Password, and any fields that should go into Drupal.

3. Test the CSV parsing
```
npm test
```

4. Import the files into Drupal
```
npm start
```
